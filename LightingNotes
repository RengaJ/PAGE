Lighting and Textures

Three main components of light:

Ambient -> color that at is everywhere ( i.e. the model is gray )
Diffuse -> adds shadowing ( i.e. the model has depth ) [ fixed ]
Specular -> adds "shine" ( i.e. the model reflects a light color ) [ dynamic ]

Lighting is now done in the fragment shader ( it used be done in the vertex shader, but it looks pretty bad )

Diffuse

I = L M  cos(theta)
 o   d d
 
Phong

R = -2N(L dot N) + L

                      S
Spec = L M (R dot eye)
        S S

Blinn-Phong
H = eye - L

                    S
Spec = L M (N dot H)
        S S
        
Eye space

Most lighting calculations involve the relationship between the location of the light,
the location of the model, and the location of the camera (eye)
Often necessary to transform the incoming vertex into eye coordinates (ec)
